# 🎨 Webflow Setup Guide for Evolve Merchant Services

## ⚠️ Important Information About Webflow

**Webflow is a visual website builder** that works differently from traditional HTML hosting:

- **Visual Editor**: Webflow uses a drag-and-drop visual editor, not direct HTML import
- **No Direct HTML Import**: Webflow doesn't allow you to upload HTML files directly
- **Rebuild Required**: You'll need to recreate the design in Webflow's visual editor

---

## 🎯 **YOUR OPTIONS FOR WEBFLOW**

### **Option 1: Rebuild in Webflow (RECOMMENDED)**

Recreate the site using Webflow's visual editor:

**Pros:**
✅ Full control with Webflow's visual editor
✅ Easy to maintain and update
✅ Webflow CMS integration available
✅ Webflow hosting included

**Cons:**
❌ Time-consuming to rebuild manually
❌ Requires learning Webflow's interface

**How to do it:**
1. Create a Webflow account at https://webflow.com
2. Create a new blank project
3. Use the visual editor to rebuild each section:
   - Navigation
   - Hero with dashboard card
   - Partner logos
   - Solutions section

**Pros:**

3. Copy sections from `index.html` into embed elements

### **Option 3: Use Third-Party Converters (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

Services like "HTML to Webflow" converters:
