# Webflow Export - Evolve Merchant Services

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Read This First!**

**Webflow does NOT support direct HTML import.**

You cannot upload `index.html` directly to Webflow. Webflow requires you to use their visual editor to build sites.

## 📁 **What's in This Folder**

- `index.html` - Complete standalone site (2,396 lines)
- `WEBFLOW-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide for Webflow setup
- This README

---

## 🎯 **You Have 3 Options:**

### **Option 1: Use Your Netlify Site (RECOMMENDED ✅)**

**Your site is already live and working perfectly!**

**Live URL:** https://same-dzeki48e65x-latest.netlify.app

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Already deployed (5 minutes ago!)
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ No rebuilding needed
- ✅ SSL certificate included
- ✅ Global CDN

**You're done!** Just use this URL.

### **Option 2: Install WordPress Theme**

**Download the ready-made WordPress theme:**

```
https://github.com/Evolveaacm/evolve-merchant-wordpress/raw/main/wordpress-theme/evolve-merchant-services.zip
```

**Installation:**
1. WordPress Admin → Appearance → Themes
2. Click "Add New" → "Upload Theme"
3. Select the ZIP file
4. Click "Install Now" → "Activate"

**Done in 2 minutes!**

---

### **Option 3: Rebuild in Webflow (NOT RECOMMENDED ❌)**

**This will take 8-20 hours of manual work.**

You'll need to:
1. Create a Webflow account
2. Manually recreate every section in the visual editor
3. Rebuild all animations
4. Recreate the particle effect
5. Set up the contact form (requires paid plan)
6. Pay $14-42/month for hosting

## 💡 **My Strong Recommendation**

**Use the Netlify site that's already deployed!**

**Why?**
- ✅ It's already done
- ✅ It's free

**Webflow would require:**
- ❌ 8-20 hours to rebuild everything manually
